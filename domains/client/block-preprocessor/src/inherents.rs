//! Provides functionality of adding inherent extrinsics to the Domain.
//! Unlike Primary chain where inherent data is first derived the block author
//! and the data is verified by the on primary runtime, domains inherents
//! short circuit the derivation and verification of inherent data
//! as the inherent data is directly taken from the primary block from which
//! domain block is being built.
//!
//! One of the first use case for this is passing Timestamp data. Before building a
//! domain block using a primary block, we take the current time from the primary runtime
//! and then create an unsigned extrinsic that is put on top the bundle extrinsics.
//!
//! Deriving these extrinsics during fraud proof verification should be possible since
//! verification environment will have access to primary chain.
